Media setup instructions
------------------------

This directory contains all media files required for a generic ESP Web site.  Top level subdirectories of note include images, scripts, styles, and uploaded.

The media directories 'images' and 'styles' are regular, tracked directories in this repository.  The previous (Dropbox-based) symbolic link scheme for file customization is no longer used; files should now be customized directly in these directories or via the admin interface described below.

The entire directory tree may be edited by administrators through the admin interface:
    /admin/filebrowser/browse/
This the preferred method for customizing image files such as logos.

Some of the files in this area are also written by the Web site itself.  For example, the themes system generates CSS stylesheets and writes image files and scripts particular to the selected theme.  It can be accessed by administrators at:
    /themes/
